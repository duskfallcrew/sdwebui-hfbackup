## About This Extension

This extension provides a simple way to back up your Stable Diffusion WebUI models, embeddings, and other important files to a repository on the Hugging Face Hub. We prioritize ease of use and reliability, helping you safeguard your valuable work.

## Key Features

*   **Easy Backup:** Back up your model files, VAEs, embeddings, and LoRAs directly from your Stable Diffusion WebUI.
*   **Hugging Face Integration:** Seamlessly upload your files to your Hugging Face Hub repository.
*   **Automatic Backup (Manual Start):** Backups are performed automatically in the background, after you manually start them using the UI.
*   **Granular Status Updates:** Clear progress information provided during the backup process.
*   **Credential Store:** The extension uses the git credential store for secure authentication, and you can opt-out by using an environment variable.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install:** Install this extension by placing it in the `extensions` folder of your Stable Diffusion WebUI.
2.  **Configure:**
    *   In the Stable Diffusion WebUI settings, go to the `Hugging Face` section and set your write access token.
    *   In the extension's UI tab, configure your Hugging Face username, repository name, paths to back up, and the SD Webui folder.
3. **Start Backup:** Click the "Start Backup" button to begin backing up your files.

## Requirements

*   Stable Diffusion WebUI (Automatic1111)
*   Hugging Face Hub account and a write access token.
*   Python 3.7 or later.

## How it Works

1. **Configuration:** When you start the extension, it will load the required settings.
2.  **Cloning or Creation:** The extension will clone the provided Hugging Face repository, or create it if it doesn't exist.
3.  **Copy Files:** The files in the specified paths will be copied to the cloned repository.
4.  **Pushing:** The changes will be pushed to your repository in the Hugging Face Hub.
5. **Scheduled backups** By default, backups are done when the user triggers them, and then after a specified interval, you can configure that interval by modifying the  `BACKUP_INTERVAL` constant in your `hfbackup_script.py` file, or by implementing a scheduler.

## Settings

### Hugging Face Settings
*  **Hugging Face Write API Key:** Required to upload to your Hugging Face Repository.
* **Use Git Credential Store:** By default the extension will try to use your system's git credentials, but you can disable this behavior by turning this toggle off, and use the environment variable `HF_TOKEN` to provide the token.

### Extension settings
* **Huggingface Token**: Your Huggingface token.
* **Huggingface Username:** Your Huggingface username or organization name.
* **SD Webui Path:** The folder where Stable Diffusion Webui is installed.
*   **Backup Paths:** The paths to your models, embeddings, etc. that you wish to back up (one path per line), it must be relative to the root folder where Stable Diffusion is installed.

## Known Issues

*   No "BACK END" settings file: Settings are saved in the script and are loaded directly by A1111.
*   Currently, the backup occurs only when the user clicks the "Start Backup" button, and then on a timer, until the extension stops.
